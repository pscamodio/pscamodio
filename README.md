Hi, Iâ€™m @pscamodio, a senior software developer currently working at FARO Technologies.

Due to the different projects I worked on my exprties is quite varied:
* I developed desktop applications in c++/Qt for most of my career, with a focus on project management and tooling (cmake/vcpkg)
* I now work mostly as a frontend developer with Typescript/React

Addittionally I like to try and experiment with new technologies, so I dirtied my hand with:
* Golang
* Rust
* Various frontend frameworks and libraries (NextJS, Vue, Svelte)
