Hi, I’m @pscamodio, a software developer currently working at FARO Technologies with a focus on c++/typescript mixed development with the help of emscripten.

Before I worked for 10 years at Open Technologies working on low level c++ library code and desktop application using mainly the Qt framework.
I'm interested in:
- Continuously trying new programming paradigms and languages
- Singing
- Cooking (with a focus on slow cooking like BBQ and Sous Vide)
- Light Novels (last good one I have red is I Alone Level Up)

For my job I’m currently learning typescript and everything around web development because my experience was mainly on desktop applications before.
